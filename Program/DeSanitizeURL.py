Description:
    Reverses the sanitization of URLs by converting obfuscated components
    such as 'hxxp' and '[.]' back to their original forms. This is useful
    for testing, analysis, or investigation purposes where the original
    URL format is required.

    ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Desanitizing URLs can make them active and potentially dangerous.
    Use with caution and only in secure environments.
