Description:
            Provides functionality to sanitize URLs by working around characters
    such as '.' and 't' so that links are no longer clickable or
    accidentally visited. Useful for safely displaying potentially
    malicious or sensitive URLs in logs, reports, or analysis.

imports:
    pyperclip ---> For clipboard manipulation
    termcolor ---> For colored text
